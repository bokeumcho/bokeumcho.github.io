**Abstract:**  
Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) are essential tools for predicting individual phenotypic risk but often lack accuracy in non-European ancestry groups. Transfer Learning for Polygenic Risk Scores (TL-PRS) addresses this challenge by leveraging European PRSs to improve prediction in underrepresented ancestries but requires privacy-sensitive individual-level data and has low computational efficiency. Therefore, we introduce PTL-PRS (Pseudovalidated Transfer Learning for PRS), an extension of TL-PRS that incorporates pseudovalidation to eliminate the need for individual-level data and includes further software optimization. For pseudovalidation, PTL-PRS generates pseudo-summary statistics for training and validation and evaluates model performance with the pseudo-R metric. To improve computational efficiency, PTL-PRS software was optimized with C++, blockwise early stopping, and direct genotype retrieval. Overall, PTL-PRS enhances both prediction accuracy and software usability, helping underrepresented populations achieve more accurate genetic risk predictions.
