[**Transfer-learning of PRS with pseudo-validation**](https://link-to-your-paper-preprint)

**Abstract:**  
- **Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS)** are critical tools for predicting disease risk, but their **utility is often limited** when the **sample size is small**.
- **Transfer Learning for PRS (TL-PRS)** [Zhao et al., 2022] aims to address this by transferring knowledge from European PRS to other populations. However, TL-PRS depends on **individual-level data**, which is often **unavailable** due to **privacy constraints**.
- To overcome this challenge, we developed **PTL-PRS (Pseudo-validated Transfer Learning for PRS)**, which integrates a novel pseudo-validation method [Zhang et al., 2021] into TL-PRS.
- **PTL-PRS** enables model validation without individual-level data by **estimating pseudo-$R^2$** using phenotype-genotype correlations from **summary statistics**, making it a **privacy-friendly** and **computationally efficient solution** for extending PRS applicability across different groups.
