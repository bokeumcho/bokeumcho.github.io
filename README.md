# Welcome to My Poster Session

Thank you for visiting my poster session! This repository contains the github repository for software implementation. Below are the link and a brief overview.

**Abstract:**  
Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) are critical tools for predicting disease risk, but their utility is often limited when the sample size is small. Transfer Learning for PRS (TL-PRS) [Zhao et al., 2022] aims to address this limitation by transferring knowledge from European PRS to other populations. However, TL-PRS depends on individual-level data, which is often unavailable due to privacy constraints. To overcome this challenge, we developed PTL-PRS (Pseudo-validated Transfer Learning for PRS), which integrates a novel pseudo-validation method [Zhang et al., 2021] into TL-PRS. PTL-PRS enables model validation without individual-level data by estimating pseudo-<i>R</i><sup>2</sup> using phenotype-genotype correlations from summary statistics, making it a privacy-friendly and computationally efficient solution for extending PRS applicability across different groups.
